# My Writing Samples
 I am using this repo to start building samples of my work.

 I was the Site Manager for <a href="https://clouddocs.f5.com" target="_blank">clouddocs.f5com</a> during my time at F5 Networks.

 My main focus was helping a distributed team develop product documentation for the BIG-IP Next project. 
 Initially, that meant documenting how to use Postman to use the API to configure and deploy the product.

 As a UI tool was developed for customers, this method was relegated to testers and advanced customers with early access to the products.
