# My Writing Samples
 I am using this repo to start building samples of my work.

 I was the Site Manager for [clouddocs.f5.com](https://clouddocs.f5.com) during my time at F5 Networks.

 My main focus was helping a distributed team develop product documentation for the BIG-IP Next project. 
 Initially, that meant documenting how to use Postman to use the API to configure and deploy the product.
